HackSheffield project

Implemented an on-line project which consists of a of an question-answering assistant. User types in a question, the assistant then thinks for a few seconds then answers the question. Questions all in natural language, so no need for formatted input.


Credits to Webknox for the Q/A API, which I used from Mashape, and to Voice RSS Â© for their Text-to-Speech API.
